# PhonoLex 2.0: Vector-Based Phonological Analysis

## Vision

PhonoLex 2.0 reimagines phonological analysis through the lens of modern computational linguistics. By leveraging vector-based representations of phonemes and words, we create a powerful, flexible framework for exploring, analyzing, and applying phonological patterns across languages.

## Core Concepts

### Vector-Based Phonology

- **Phoneme Vectors**: Each phoneme represented as a vector of phonological features derived from PHOIBLE
- **Similarity Metrics**: Calculate phonological similarity through vector distances
- **Word Embeddings**: Compose phoneme vectors into word-level representations
- **Gradient Matching**: Move beyond binary pattern matching to similarity-based matching
- **Cross-Linguistic Transfer**: Map between phonological systems of different languages

### Enhanced Wordlists

- **Curated Core Vocabulary**: Carefully selected wordlists of actual dictionary words (no proper nouns)
- **Domain-Specific Collections**: Academic, technical, and specialized vocabulary sets
- **Frequency-Based Tiers**: Words categorized by frequency and register
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on well-documented words with reliable phonological information
- **Cross-Referenced Sources**: Multiple high-quality sources (WordNet, SCOWL, etc.) for verification

### Use Cases

1. **Speech Pathology**
   - Generate minimal pairs with configurable complexity
   - Create target-focused word lists
   - Design difficulty gradients for therapy sequences
   - Track progression through sound acquisition

2. **Linguistic Research**
   - Explore phonological typology
   - Analyze phonotactic constraints
   - Discover latent phonological patterns
   - Model sound changes as vector transformations

3. **Education**
   - Visualize phonological space
   - Generate phonological awareness materials
   - Create custom teaching resources
   - Support language learning applications

4. **Creative Applications**
   - Generate rhyme and alliteration patterns
   - Assist with lyric and poetry composition
   - Create word games based on sound patterns
   - Invent novel words following natural phonotactics

## Technical Architecture

### Data Foundation

- **Primary Source**: PHOIBLE database for cross-linguistic phoneme inventory
- **Word Dictionaries**: Curated dictionaries from WordNet, SCOWL, etc.
- **Feature System**: Standardized feature vectors for all phonemes
- **Storage**: Vector database for efficient similarity search

### Wordlist Sources and Processing

- **Primary Sources**:
  - WordNet: Comprehensive lexical database with semantic connections
  - SCOWL: Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists, carefully categorized by frequency and usage
  - GNU Aspell Dictionary: Clean word lists with minimal noise
  - BNC/COCA Word Family Lists: Frequency-based groupings

- **Filtering Criteria**:
  - Exclude proper nouns and abbreviations
  - Exclude hyphenated compounds and non-standard forms
  - Focus on base words and regular inflections
  - Include common derivational forms

- **Metadata Enrichment**:
  - Frequency information from modern corpora
  - Part of speech tagging
  - Syllable boundaries
  - Morphological analysis
  - Stress patterns
  - Register information (formal, informal, technical, etc.)

### Core Components

1. **Vector Engine**
   - Phoneme vectorization
   - Distance metrics
   - Composition strategies
   - Dimensionality reduction for visualization

2. **Pattern DSL**
   - Domain-specific language for phonological patterns
   - Support for traditional and vector-based queries
   - Pattern composition and transformation
   - Fuzzy matching with configurable thresholds

3. **Analysis Tools**
   - Phonological similarity search
   - Pattern extraction from word sets
   - Statistical analysis of phonological properties
   - Cross-linguistic comparison

4. **Visualization**
   - Interactive phoneme space explorer
   - Word trajectories through phonological space
   - Feature comparison visualizations
   - Phonological neighborhood maps

## Implementation Plan
