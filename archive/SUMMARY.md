# PhonoLex Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've built a Python package called PhonoLex that provides a phonological lexicon with vector-based representation for phoneme features. The package leverages the `seqrule` library to define and validate phonological rules for phoneme sequences.

## Key Components

1. **Package Structure**
   - Organized as a proper Python package with `src/phonolex` structure
   - Well-defined modules for rules, API, models, and utilities
   - Integration with `seqrule` for sequence rule processing

2. **Phonological Rules System**
   - Feature-based matching rules
   - Natural class rules
   - Environment-based rules
   - Assimilation and dissimilation rules
   - Syllable structure rules
   - Sonority sequence rules
   - Vowel harmony rules
   - Phonotactic constraint rules

3. **FastAPI Web Server**
   - RESTful API for phonological rule checking
   - Endpoints for features, natural classes, and rule validation
   - Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - Interactive API documentation

4. **Example Scripts**
   - Demonstration of rule creation and checking
   - API client example
   - Running scripts for ease of use

## Technical Highlights

1. **Modular Design**
   - Clean separation of concerns between modules
   - Easily extensible for new rule types
   - Well-documented public interfaces

2. **Modern Python Practices**
   - Type hints and Pydantic models
   - FastAPI for high-performance web API
   - Proper package structure with pyproject.toml
   - Support for uv package manager

3. **Phonological Concepts**
   - Comprehensive set of phonological features
   - Natural class definitions
   - Rule-based phonological processing

## Next Steps

1. **Data Processing**
   - Implement data pipeline for processing raw phonological data
   - Add support for different feature systems (PHOIBLE, Hayes, etc.)

2. **Vector Representations**
   - Add vector-based similarity calculation
   - Implement dimensionality reduction for visualization

3. **API Enhancements**
   - Add endpoints for word lookup
   - Support for rule application to transform words
   - Batch processing capabilities

4. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Implement unit and integration tests
   - Add more examples and tutorials
