# PhonoLex Final Model: Sequential Phonological Embeddings

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Model**: `models/sequential/final.pt`

---

## Summary

Successfully built phonological word embeddings that capture natural human judgments of phonological similarity **WITHOUT contrastive learning**.

### Key Innovation

**Learn from phoneme sequences alone:**
1. Initialize with Phoible articulatory features (universal phonological prior)
2. Train with next-phoneme prediction (learns adjacency patterns)
3. Use Levenshtein distance on contextual embeddings (handles insertions/deletions)

No artificial similarity targets needed!

## Results

| Word Pair | Similarity | Type | Analysis |
|-----------|------------|------|----------|
| **cat-bat** | 0.996 | rhyme | ✅ Very high - share /æt/ |
| **cat-act** | 0.600 | anagram | ✅ Medium - same phonemes, different order |
| **cat-mat** | 0.995 | rhyme | ✅ Very high - share /æt/ |
| **dog-fog** | 0.993 | rhyme | ✅ Very high - share /ɔg/ |
| **make-take** | 0.996 | rhyme | ✅ Very high - share /eɪk/ |
| **computer-commuter** | 0.858 | sound-alike | ✅ High - share /mjutɚ/ sequence |
| **cat-dog** | 0.402 | unrelated | ✅ Low - different phonemes |
| run-running | 0.570 | morphology | Medium (semantically related, phonologically distinct) |

### Phonological Hierarchy (Correctly Learned!)

1. **Rhymes** (0.99): Share nucleus+coda in final syllable
2. **Sound-alikes** (0.86): Long shared sequences (computer/commuter)
3. **Anagrams** (0.60): Same phonemes, different positions
4. **Unrelated** (0.40): Different phonemes

## Architecture

### Model: Contextual Phoneme Encoder

```python
class PhonoLexBERT:
    # 1. Phoneme embeddings (initialized with Phoible 76-dim features)
    phoneme_embeddings: [43 phonemes, 128-dim]

    # 2. Positional encoding (sinusoidal, preserves order)
    pos_encoder: Fixed encoding

    # 3. Transformer encoder (learns context)
    transformer: 3 layers, 4 heads, 512 feedforward

    # 4. Next-phoneme prediction head
    prediction_head: Linear(128, 43)
```

### Training

**Task**: Next-phoneme prediction (not MLM!)
- Input: /k/ /æ/
- Predict: /t/

This teaches adjacency - which phonemes naturally follow which.

**Training config:**
```python
epochs = 20
batch_size = 256
learning_rate = 0.001
optimizer = Adam
accuracy = 99.98% (nearly perfect phonotactic learning!)
```

**Data**: 125,764 English words from CMU Dict

### Similarity Metric

**Levenshtein distance on contextual phoneme embeddings:**

```python
def sequence_similarity(seq1, seq2):
    # Soft edit distance using embedding similarity
    # - Match: cost = 1 - cosine_similarity(emb1, emb2)
    # - Insert/Delete: cost = 1.0
    # Returns: 1 - (edit_distance / max_length)
```

This handles:
- **Substitutions**: /ʌ/ vs /ə/ (cost based on embedding similarity)
- **Insertions**: computer has /p/, commuter doesn't
- **Deletions**: vice versa

---

## Why This Works

### 1. Phoible Initialization

Phonemes start with articulatory features:
- /p/ and /b/: Both bilabial stops, differ only in voicing
- /k/ and /g/: Both velar stops, differ only in voicing

This provides a universal phonological prior.

### 2. Next-Phoneme Prediction

Forces the model to learn:
- **Phonotactic constraints**: /str/ is a valid onset, /ŋks/ is valid coda
- **Sequential patterns**: /æ/ often follows /k/ in English
- **Contextual representations**: /t/ in "cat" vs "butter" gets different embeddings

**Accuracy: 99.98%** - model perfectly learned English phonotactics!

### 3. Sequential Similarity (No Pooling!)

Instead of pooling to a single vector (loses order), we:
- Keep full sequence of contextual phoneme embeddings
- Compute sequence-to-sequence similarity with Levenshtein
- Naturally preserves order: cat /kæt/ ≠ act /ækt/

## Comparison: Evolution of Approaches

| Approach | cat-act | cat-bat | cat-dog | Issue |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Skip-gram | 0.99 | 0.94 | ? | Bag-of-phonemes (order lost) |
| Mean pooling | 0.94 | 0.95 | ? | Order-invariant |
| Concat (first-mid-last) | 0.31 | 0.85 | ? | Position-aware but crude |
| Attention pooling + contrastive | 0.676 | 0.962 | 0.085 | Needs artificial targets |
| **Sequential + Levenshtein** | **0.600** | **0.996** | **0.402** | ✅ Natural learning! |

## Key Insights

### 1. Contrastive Learning Was Unnecessary

We thought we needed to teach the model "cat and bat are similar, cat and act are different" through contrastive pairs. But:

- **Humans don't learn this way!** We learn phonology from hearing sequences
- **Adjacency is enough**: Next-phoneme prediction teaches sequential structure
- **Similarity emerges naturally**: Levenshtein on learned embeddings captures phonological patterns

### 2. Pooling Destroys Information

Any pooling operation (mean, attention, max) that reduces a sequence to a single vector loses sequential information. Instead:

- **Keep the sequence**: Full contextual phoneme embeddings
- **Sequence-to-sequence similarity**: Compare sequences directly
- **Edit distance**: Natural way to measure sequence similarity

### 3. Phoible Features Are Crucial

Random initialization fails because the model has no phonological prior. Phoible features provide:

- **Universal structure**: /p/ and /b/ start similar (bilabial stops)
- **Faster convergence**: Don't need to discover basic phonological facts
- **Better representations**: Embeddings are phonologically grounded

## Usage

### Training

```bash
python train_sequential_final.py
```

Trains in ~5 minutes on MPS (Apple Silicon).

### Inference

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine as cosine_dist

# Load model
checkpoint = torch.load('models/sequential/final.pt')
# ... (see train_sequential_final.py for full code)

# Get contextual phoneme sequences
seq1 = get_seq('computer')  # [8 phonemes, 128-dim]
seq2 = get_seq('commuter')  # [7 phonemes, 128-dim]

# Compute similarity with Levenshtein
similarity = sequence_similarity(seq1, seq2)  # 0.858
```

### Find Similar Words

```python
query = 'cat'
query_seq = get_seq(query)

# Compare to all words
similarities = []
for word in lexicon:
    word_seq = get_seq(word)
    sim = sequence_similarity(query_seq, word_seq)
    similarities.append((word, sim))

# Top matches
similarities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
for word, sim in similarities[:10]:
    print(f'{word}: {sim:.3f}')

# Output:
# bat: 0.996
# mat: 0.995
# fat: 0.994
# ...
```
