### Description

### Data
The data folder includes four files: cmu.json, features.json, commonlemmas.txt, and commonwords.txt. 
#### *cmu.json*
This file contains a json version of the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary][1]. It includes a dictionary of English vocabulary terms as keys and an ordered list of phonemes with stress indicated. There are approximately 135k words, some of which are represented more than once with alternate proncunciations.

| WORD |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |
|:-----|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|banana|  B  | AH0 |  N  | AE1 |  N  | AH0 |
</details>

#### *features.json*
This file maps the ARPAbet symbols for phonemes used in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary to their corresponding phonological features. These features were derived from the definitions of those symbols. Several features are described, for example:

|    FEATURE   | 'IH' |
|:-------------|-----:|
|TYPE          | V    |
|HEIGHT        | 0.2  |
|DEPTH         | 0.75 |
|ROUNDED       | 0    |
|RHOTIC        | 1    |
|STOP          | None |
|VOICE         | None |
|BILABIAL      | None |
|AFFRICATE     | None |
|ALVEOPALATAL  | None |
|ALVEOLAR      | None |
|FRICATIVE     | None |
|DENTAL        | None |
|LABIODENTAL   | None |
|VELAR         | None |
|LATERAL       | 0    |
|POSTALVEOLAR  | None |
|NASAL         | None |
|LABIOVELAR    | None |
|PALATAL       | None |
|GLIDE         | None |
|GLOTTAL       | None |
</details>

The values may have the following data types: string (for TYPE, i.e., vowel or consonant), float (for all numerical values, even those that are binary), None (for the cases in which a feature is not relevant/possible), and list (for ranges of values as in the case of diphthongs or search queries). Numerical values were derived in two ways: binary values come from the simple presence or absence of the feature, e.g., RHOTIC; other values come from the relative distance of a feature on a continuum. Continuous features are typically described as discrete values that divide a continuum. In the case of HEIGHT, this can be anywhere from 3 to 7 values. Here, 6 values are possible (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0).

#### *commonwords.txt*
This file contains 5027 of the most common words in English derived from the [Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)][2] 2020 data. The original lists were obtained from www.wordfrequency.info. This particular list contains words and their various forms that also made the top 5027. Duplicates were removed and a new file was generated by cross-referencing the CMU vocabulary (so phonetic descriptions could be obtained). Specifying this file allows the user to avoid obscure results, although there is a smaller *unique* vocabulary than in the next file.

#### *commonlemmas.txt*
This file contains 4369 of the most common lemmas in English derived from the same corpus. Lemmas are the so-called 'dictionary' form of the word, so the list contains a richer unique vocabulary, albeit fewer words altogether. Again, duplicates were removed and the included list has been cross-referenced with the CMU vocabulary.
